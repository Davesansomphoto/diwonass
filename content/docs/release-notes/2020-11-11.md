### Segment Refresh Cadence Improvements

Existing contacts who meet a segmentâ€™s criteria will now appear in your segment searches within 15 minutes. This refresh cadence allows you to more accurately determine which of your contacts are associated with a segment. Newly added or modified contacts will be checked for hourly.

The refresh cadence has also been made available to [Marketing Campaigns API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/segmenting-contacts/create-segment) users via the `next_sample_update` field.

For more information about the segment refresh cadence, see our [segmentation documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts/#segment-refresh-cadence).

### Preview Segment Sample Contacts

When hovering over the number of contacts in a segment, a tool tip will display the next scheduled refresh of the segment's data. You can see all contacts who are included in the segment at any given time by exporting the list to a CSV.
