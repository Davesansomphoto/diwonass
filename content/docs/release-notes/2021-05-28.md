## Exclude Recipients from Single Sends

You can now exclude contacts from a Single Send based on list or segment membership. Any contacts on an exclusion list or segment who are also on any of your ‘Send To’ lists or segments will not receive the Single Send. You can exclude up to 5 segments or 50 lists.

The ability to exclude contacts from a send can help with many marketing use cases. For example, a marketer might manage sending frequency by excluding contacts who were sent another marketing email within the past 3 days. Or, they might re-send a promotion to a set list of contacts, excluding those who were sent the first Single Send email.
