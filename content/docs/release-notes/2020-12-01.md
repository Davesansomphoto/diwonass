## New column layouts available for the Marketing Campaigns Design Editor

The Marketing Campaigns Design Editor now supports three and four column layouts divided among common width ratios, including 1:2, 2:1, 1:3, and 3:1 layouts. These new layouts allow you to create dynamic email designs using only the drag and drop modules. Each column contains multiple drop zones where you can add non-column modules such as buttons, text, and images.
