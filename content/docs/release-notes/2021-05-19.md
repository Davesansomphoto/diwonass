## SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO)

You can now integrate Twilio SendGrid with identity and access management platforms that support SAML 2.0 such as Okta, Duo, and Microsoft Azure. Twilio SendGrid SSO integration allows you to securely and centrally manage account permissions, including password requirements, multi-factor authentication, and employee offboarding. Twilio SendGrid SSO provides access to those who need it by mapping new Twilio SendGrid [Teammates]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/teammates/) to users in your SSO Identity Provider (IdP). Please note that each SSO user can access only one account or subuser during the Public Beta.

Visit our [documentation]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/sso/) for more information on how to access and manage SSO permissions.
