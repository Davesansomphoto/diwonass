## Support for undo and redo functionality in the Design and Code Editors

You can now undo or redo recent changes made in the Design and Code Editors. To undo an action, use the undo arrow in the top navigation above the editor, or use the `Ctrl` or `Cmd` + `Z` keyboard shortcut. To redo an action, use the redo arrow in the top navigation above the editor, or use the `Ctrl` or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `Z` keyboard shortcut. You can not undo/redo changes once you have left the browser session.
