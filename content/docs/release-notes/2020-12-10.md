## Signup Form Field Enhancement 

You can now add any [reserved field]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/custom-fields/#reserved-fields) or [custom fields]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/custom-fields/) to a signup form. This means marketers can capture more of the data that they rely on when contacts sign up via a signup form. The collected data will then flow directly into Contacts directly in Marketing Campaigns.
